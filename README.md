# MERN Intern Coding Challenge


## Introduction
Welcome to the MERN Intern Coding Challenge! This project is designed to test your skills in developing a full-stack web application using the MERN stack. You'll be creating a simple application with the following functionalities:
- User authentication
- CRUD operations
- Responsive UI

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mern-intern-challenge.git
cd mern-intern-challenge
```

## Project Structure
Here's an overview of the project's structure:

```

## Installation
### Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Create a `.env` file and add your MongoDB URI and other environment variables:
    ```env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage
### Backend
1. Start the backend server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

### Frontend
1. Start the frontend development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints
Here are some of the main API endpoints you'll be working with:

- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Login a user
- `GET /api/items`: Get all items
- `POST /api/items`: Create a new item
- `PUT /api/items/:id`: Update an item
- `DELETE /api/items/:id`: Delete an item

## Features
- User authentication (register, login, logout)

- Responsive design with React
- State management with Redux (optional)

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
